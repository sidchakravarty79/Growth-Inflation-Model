# Growth-Inflation-Model
GIP model for asset allocation
Growth, Inflation, Policy (GIP) predictive model is aimed at codifying the investment principles of Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio. The objective of the project is to predict two factors: economic growth and inflation that are central to forecasting financial market returns. The model will track year-over-year, rate of change of various macro factors to better understand the big "MACRO setup" and assist with asset allocation.
